# Azure-Pacemaker-Attack
Here are the recordings of the project and experimental steps

Experimental Device: Medtronic Azure XT SR MRI SureScan pacemaker (SN: RNE603217S)

Related App: Medtronic MyCareLink, nRF Connect (general-used Bluetooth App)

## Experimental Design:

1. Try to sniff the communication between the pacemaker and the MyCareLink App, establish how patient info retrieval is implemented. The sniffing recordings and analysis are stored in the **MyCareLinkApp_RNE603217S_Connect** directory.

2. Try to connect the pacemaker using the mobile general-used App, and see the difference between this and the captured communication using the MyCareLink App. The recordings and analysis are stored in the **nRFConnectApp_RNE603217S_Attempt** directory.
