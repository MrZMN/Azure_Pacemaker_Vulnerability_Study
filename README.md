# Azure-Pacemaker-Attack
Here are the recordings of the project and experimental steps

Experimental Device: Medtronic Azure XT SR MRI SureScan pacemaker (SN: RNE603217S; RNE606526S)

Related App: Medtronic MyCareLink, nRF Connect (general-used Bluetooth App)

## Experimental Design:

1. Try to sniff the communication between the pacemaker and the MyCareLink App, establish how patient info retrieval is implemented. The sniffing recordings and analysis are stored in the **MyCareLinkApp_RNE603217S_Connect** directory.

2. Try to connect the pacemaker using the mobile general-used App, and see the difference between this and the captured communication using the MyCareLink App. The recordings and analysis are stored in the **nRFConnectApp_RNE603217S_Attempt** directory.

3. Based on SweynTooth tool (https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/sweyntooth_bluetooth_low_energy_attacks), apply buffer overflow attack on Dialog DA14580 SoC and Azure pacemaker (which uses the same SoC). See what the buffer overfolw attack will trigger on the pacemaker. And if possible, find more general vulnerabilities on the pacemaker/Dialog DA14580 SoC.
