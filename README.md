# Azure-Pacemaker-Attack
This repository backups the experimental processes of the Medtronic pacemaker attack project.

Attacked Devices: two Medtronic Azure XT SR MRI SureScan pacemakers (Sequence Number: RNE603217S; RNE606526S), cf. https://europe.medtronic.com/xd-en/healthcare-professionals/products/cardiac-rhythm/pacemakers/azure.html; Dialog DA14580 SoC (the underlying SoC of the Azure pacemaker)

Apps: Medtronic MyCareLink, nRF Connect (a general Bluetooth App)

## Experimental Design:

1. Sniff the communication between the pacemaker and the official MyCareLink App (they need to be pre-bonded in the hospital). Reverse engineer the protocol and see how patient data is retrieved. The sniffing recordings and corresponding analysis are stored in the **MyCareLinkApp_RNE603217S_Connect** directory.

2. Connect the pacemaker with the nRF Connect App, and see the difference between the communications of step 2 and step 1. The recordings and analysis are stored in the **nRFConnectApp_RNE603217S_Attempt** directory.

3. Based on SweynTooth tool (cf. https://github.com/Matheus-Garbelini/sweyntooth_bluetooth_low_energy_attacks), apply buffer overflow attack on both Dialog DA14580 SoC and Azure pacemaker. See what the buffer overfolw attack triggers on them. And if possible, find more similar and general vulnerabilities on these devices.
